### Data Input
To add data to Secan, select the 'Add Data' button located in the bottom right of the application. A file explorer dialog box will appear in order to select the desired SEC data for analysis. This data must be stored as a .txt or .csv. Currently, data exported from the following systems are supported:
* Tosoh EcoSEC
  * Header: two lines
  * Data: alternating retention time and intensity
  * Footer: none
In order to successfully import the data, the data file must not be modified in any way. When the data is successfully imported, a line corresponding to each trace will appear in the 'Graph' tab.

### Displaying Data


### Tabs
The application data analysis functions are organized into three tabs: 'Graph', 'Analysis', and 'Calibration'. Each tab controls a different aspect of the SEC traces.
